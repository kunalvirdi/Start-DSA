# Start-DSA
## LANGUAGE SELECTION

Pick any programming language of your choice. If you want to build DSA from scratch, I'll suggest C/C++.

## LEARN THE BASICS

For a fantastic building, you need an extraordinary basement. Get a good understanding of pointers, structures, classes, dynamic memory allocation, and recursion. Learn how to find time and space complexities of algorithms and learn about the notations.

## ARRAYS (Data Structures)

Learn about what is an array, how do they work, how data is stored in an array, how memory is managed in an array, and all other things. After knowing the basics of arrays, learn about the operations that we can perform on arrays like, insertion, deletion, replacing, searching, etc.

## Searching algorithms.

Learn basic searching algorithms such as, Linear search and Binary search, with their time complexities and use cases. There are many searching algorithms but learning these first will give a clear understanding of others.

## Sorting algorithms.

Learn basic sorting algorithms that follow a NORMAL APPROACH such as selection sort, bubble sort, etc.

## DIVIDE AND CONQUER (Algorithms)

Learn about Divide and Conquer methodology. Sorting algorithms such as merge sort, quick sort, and others follow this methodology.

## LINKED LISTS (Data Structures)

Learn about what is a linked list, how do they work, how data is stored, how memory is managed, and all other things. After knowing the basics of linked lists, learn about the operations that we can perform on them like insertion, deletion, searching, traversing, reversing, etc. Learn about their applications. Also know the different types of linked lists.

## TREES AND GRAPHS (Data Structures)

Now we are coming to the most important part. Learn about binary trees, binary search trees, traversal methods, the height of a tree, and all other operations. Learn about the Depth-first search and Breadth-first search.

The same goes for Graphs. A tree, in fact, is a special type of graph.

Almost all algorithmic concepts that come under trees will definitely come under graphs.

Do an IN-DEPTH analysis for understanding these data structures.
